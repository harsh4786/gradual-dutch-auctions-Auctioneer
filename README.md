# gradual-dutch-auctions-Auctioneer 

Inspired by the paper from Paradigm Research on Gradual Dutch Auction,
  https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/gda, I tried to implement this on Solana using metaplex's auction house and auctioneer interface.
 Note that I have reused alot of code from Metaplex, taken insipiration from Synthetify for their precious Decimal math.
